# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` for community health.
- `.github/` directory with issue templates, PR template, and CI workflows (markdown lint, JSON validation, link check, PowerShell extraction + PSScriptAnalyzer).
- `.editorconfig`, `.markdownlint.json`, `.prettierrc`, `.gitignore` for consistent local tooling.
- `docs/adr/` with the four core architecture decisions extracted from the prompt's section 4.
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` as a standalone, indexable troubleshooting guide.
- `docs/faq.md`, `docs/glossary.md`, `docs/comparison.md` for discoverability.
- `examples/` with anonymized sample vault content (`MEMORY.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `PROJECTS/example-app.md`).
- `schema.json` for `manifest.json`, with a real `$id` and `$schema` reference.
- Prompt section 8.8 hardening: pinning of `@smith-and-web/obsidian-mcp-server`, logging via `Start-Transcript`, log rotation guidance, `Uninstall-Cursor-Memory.ps1`, `Repair.ps1`.
- `README.en.md` (English version) and language switcher at the top of `README.md`.
- Badges in `README.md`: license, last commit, prompt version, tested platform.

### Changed

- `manifest.json` now points to the local `schema.json` instead of the `package.json` schema (which was incorrect).
- `manifest.json` adds `version: "1.0.0"`.
- `AGENTS.md` updated to reflect the new repo structure.
- README structure: added "Quality and CI" section, made Windows-only stance explicit, added compatibility matrix.

### Removed

- Empty placeholder directories (`docs/`, `examples/`, `scripts/`, `template/`) that previously confused readers (the README explicitly says "no scripts in this repo" while four empty script-shaped directories sat at the root).

## [0.x] - pre 1.0

Prior history was undocumented and is summarized only in git log. Highlights:

- Initial guide (Spanish) explaining the Cursor + Obsidian MCP + GitHub pattern.
- Rewrite as an exhaustive operational brief (`PROMPT_ULTRA_COMPLETO.md`).
- Trim of the repo to "prompt only, no scripts" model.
- Addition of `AGENTS.md` and `manifest.json` for machine-readable discoverability.
- Seven hardening fixes for real-world install gaps.
